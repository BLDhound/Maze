# Overview
The 3D Maze Game with Raycasting is an old favourite that allows players to utilize first-person perspective to navigate a maze using raycasting technology - pioneered in titles like Wolfenstein 3D - casting rays from each frame back towards them to produce an interactive 3D rendering of each maze segment.

As an introduction to raycasting algorithms, this project serves as a prerequisite to developing more sophisticated 3D games.

# Functions of the Game
Features include a first-person view, real-time graphics using Raycasting for real-time rendering and procedurally generated mazes with simple wall collision detection as goals and criteria for success - keeping score and clocking - set into action in your 3D maze game:

1. Step 1: Download or clone the source code onto your machine. 
2. Step 2: Ensure you're working in an optimal development environment and all required dependencies are setup properly. 
3. Step 3: Navigate to the folder with your project files.
4. Step 4: Create the project using environment-specific build commands. 
5. Step 5: Launch the game's executable file.


## Controls

- **W** to move forward
- **S** to move backwards 
- **A** for left strafing 
- **D** for right strafing 
- **Space** for jumping (if enabled) 
- **Esc** to pause/resume play or access the main menu

Note that game controls may differ between versions. Additional guidance on how to operate them can be found either within the game itself or through its repository.

## Gameplay
Finding your way out of a maze is the goal of this game, so to win you must navigate from starting point through it to exit side without getting stuck! Each run through is unique as its layout changes each time.

Utilizing the controls outlined above, players can navigate their way through a maze using creative navigation skills. Their path will be blocked by walls and obstacles which require them to come up with strategies on how to overcome them in order to progress further. Power-ups, enemies and puzzles could all increase difficulty and add extra layers to this engaging game experience.

## Customization | Tweaks for Personalisation
Additional tweaks can be found both within-game and by altering its code, giving players an array of customization options such as:

## Explore the Dimensions of the Maze
Rendering and Graphic Options for Rendering the Maze Player Abilities such as Speed and Vertical Leap Game Difficulty New Elements to Add (Bosses, Weapons etc) Sound and Image Modulation.
Customisation options in your game's implementation can be found within its documentation or source code.

1. Start by forking the repository. 
2. Next, create a separate branch dedicated to your new functionality or bug fix. 
3. Make the necessary alterations and save before committing your changes using helpful commit messages. 
4. Push out your revised commit back onto the branch from which it originated.
5. Create and merge in a pull request
